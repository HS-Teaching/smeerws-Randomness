# smeerws-Randomness

### Project description: 
A 2D Unity project to showcase some different examples for using Randomness (System.Random and UnityEngine.Random).
The first example shows how to randomly change text.
The second example randomizes the color of sprites.
With the third and fourth example change the position and size based on a randomizer.
The last example shows how simply shuffle colors of UI Images when using Lists.
